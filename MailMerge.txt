To mail merge on MS Word:
open template letter
Mailings/Start Mail Merge/letters
Select recipients / use exisiting
   switch All Data Sources drop-down to All Files
   navigate to the csv data file
   open it
   
Then, actually, I open Mail Wizard and go from there.

"Start Mail Merge"/ Step-by-Step Mail Merge Wizard:
On step 4 click "More Items".  Make sure mouse is in right location.
Close box each time.
In step 6 "print" then choose pdf printer (print to desktop)

These remaining instructions may or may not help!
I print to a PDF so I can sanity check it before wasting the paper!   
   
Click Preview Results.  Option: Can insert (adjust) merge fields
Edit recipient list if desired to get rid of bad lines (but it didn't work anyhow)
Finish and merge / edit individual docs (all) [OK]
File Export to PDF


To make labels:
Open blank
Mailings
Start Mail Merge
Labels
Choose correct label template
Select recipients / use exisiting
   switch All Data Sources drop-down to All Files
   navigate to the csv data file
   open it
Click Preview Results.
Finish/Merge
Edit individual.... All  OK
Print to PDF.
(Except that fails)
