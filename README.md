# FCC_HAM_DATA
This code is in Python3. Right now it's just in use by myself for the GMRA ham radio club, but I hope to improve
on it so others can make use of it.  The idea is to download the FCC Ham License database and run it to find out who
has recently gotten their license in your area or moved in to town. Then clubs can send out invitations for people to
join their clubs!
